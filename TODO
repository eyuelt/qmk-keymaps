TODO:
- create a makefile where you can say "make <directory>" and it will do what
  needs to be done to generate the appropriate hex file in the root directory.
- each directory should have a small config file that specifies the keyboard
  (keymap name is generated so doesn't need to be provided by the user)
- also generate a printout of the key layout using qmk-comment-gen (or something
  similar)
- fix up build.sh. maybe rewrite in python. it should be run from the makefile
- make sure there is a "make clean" command that clears out qmk_firmware (and
  the generated hex files)
- don't use git pull, since there may be merge conflicts
- figure out how to communicate between halves of the keyboard and then use that
  to let the slave keyboard know about layer changes so that it can change the
  leds accordingly
- clean up TODOs
- turns out you can flash your keyboard without the use of QMK toolbox (see
  here: https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/11146). maybe add a make
  command that will automatically do the flash (presuming the keyboard is in
  bootloader mode)
- also try to flash the two sides of the keyboard with different firmwares to
  see if we can use whichever one we want as the master (maybe don't do this
  until the led communication across the sides is figured out, just in case
  the different firmwares will mess it up). if this works (or maybe even if it
  doesn't, since it could be that the slave's mapping is still being used when
  it is a slave... i think this is true for leds), then we can change the code
  to automatically change the mapping based on which half is set as the master,
  that way we can have the same firmware for same halves
